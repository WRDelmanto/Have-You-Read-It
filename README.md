## About
JuriDoc is an AI-powered legal automation platform designed for Brazilian lawyers, enabling the fast and secure creation of powers of attorney and fee agreements. By extracting client data from scanned ID documents using OCR, and filling pre-uploaded Word templates, JuriDoc streamlines legal document generation, integrates with digital signature platforms (like Clicksign and DocuSign), and organizes files by client and case typeâ€”delivering speed, legal accuracy, and scalability for modern law practices.
